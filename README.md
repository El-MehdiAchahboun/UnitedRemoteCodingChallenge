# GitHubRepos

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.
The goal is to implement a webapp that will list the most starred Github repositories that were created in the last 30 days. 

## What's Angular ?

_AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications._


## Why Angular?

The strong sides of Angular include:
> **Detailed documentation** where developers can find all necessary information without asking their colleagues. As a result, developers can quickly come up with technical solutions and resolve emerging issues.

> **Support by Google** which is another benefit of Angular, making the platform trustworthy. At ng-conf 2017, the developers of Angular confirmed that Google will support Angular on a long-term basis.

> **Great ecosystem of third-party components** that comes from the appearance of thousands of additional tools and components that can be used in Angular apps. As a result, you can get additional functionality and productivity improvements.

> **Component-based architecture** the app is divided into independent logical and functional components. These components can easily be replaced and decoupled as well as reused in other parts of an app. In addition, component independence makes it easy to test a web app and ensure that every component works seamlessly.

> **CLI** is probably the most beloved feature for the majority of Angular developers. It automates the whole development process making app initialization, configuration, and development as easy as possible.

> **Dependency injection** to define how various components are connected and show how changes in one part of the code affects other parts. On the one hand, using dependency injection makes code more readable and maintainable. It can greatly reduce the time spent testing and hence cut the costs of web development. But on the other hand, dependency injection may be time-consuming and it may be hard to create dependencies for components.

## What’s Moment.js?

</p>

_Very briefly, vanilla library is a JavaScript code for manipulating dates and time, without other dependencies provided; it’s a powerful tool for parsing, validating and displaying dates. When dates should be displayed in a localized format provided by user location and the right format, it supports internationalization and time zone – which is quite important for developers._

## Why Moment.js ?
> It works in both the browser and Node.js environments.

> It supports i18n (internationalization) and l10n (localization) which is particularly important for frontend developers.

> The bundle of available options is amazing: it provides almost everything that a frontend developer may use in an application.

</p>

_An Angular UI library `ng-zorro-antd` that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces._

## Why Ant Design NG-ZORRO ?

> An enterprise-class UI design language for web applications.

> A set of high-quality Angular components out of the box.

> Written in TypeScript with complete defined types.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
